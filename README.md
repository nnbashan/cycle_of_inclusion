Abstract:

This study examines the impact of a fare-free bike-sharing system on different communities in Boston, following the closure of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Orange Line. Using open-source Bluebikes ridership data and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method, we analyzed trip purposes and distances during a fare-free period. Our findings reveal that fare-free policies can enhance mobility and accessibility to essential services, especially in low-income and high-density areas. The redistribution of trip purposes throughout the day suggests increased usage for a variety of activities, not limited to commuting. Spatial analysis indicated significant ridership increases near metro lines, with a gradual rise in low-income and high-density areas. Our results highlight the potential of fare-free bike-sharing programs to promote transit equity and enhance urban mobility.}
